"""Typed per-test metadata for the e2e suite: what a test drives, and what it did.

Two halves, deliberately separated.

The DECLARED half is `Subject`: one frozen dataclass passed as the single
positional argument of `@meta(...)`. Every field is a closed enum (or a free
string for `model`), so a typo is a basedpyright error at the call site rather
than a silently dropped property. `dataclasses.asdict()` turns the whole thing
into <property> pairs with no per-field plumbing -- adding a scalar field later
needs zero serializer changes.

The RECORDED half is `steps`, and it is NOT a field of `Subject`. Steps are
appended at runtime by `@step`-decorated harness helpers, in call order, so the
list IS the test's user story and its last element is where a failing test died.
Putting it on the declarable dataclass would invite hand-writing it, which is
exactly what it replaces.

Stdlib-only on purpose, and that includes the call sites. tests/e2e is a
black-box HTTP suite that imports litellm in zero files and is shipped to the
runner image as tests/e2e alone; a `from litellm...` at the top of a test module
would make the litellm package a COLLECTION-time dependency of the whole suite,
so an image without it would fail collection rather than run tests. `Provider`
below therefore mirrors litellm's `LlmProviders` values here instead of
importing them, and `TestProviderMirrorsLitellm` in test_junit_properties.py
fails wherever litellm IS importable if the two ever drift.
